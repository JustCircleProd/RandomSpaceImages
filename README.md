## Featuresüî≠

Random Space Images combines the content of the two apps, allowing you to view both the Astronomy Picture of the Day and Random Space Images. At the same time, the app does not lose its simplicity and clarity, thanks to a proper separation of content and a light and user-friendliness, but at the same time beautiful and modern interface.

### Tech explanation

The design is 100% based on Compose, Fragments are only used for Navigation, because some problems were found in Compose Navigation with saving states.
Therefore, a hybrid way was chosen, maximizing the benefits of usual and modern solutions.

The principle of "Single Activity" is used. The application is built using MVVM.

API queries are done with Retrofit2, data is converted into Kotlin DataClass with Gson Converter.

Room is used to store favorites.
DataStore is used to store user settings, such as application theme and start screen.
